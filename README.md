bosonnlo - Boson NLP SDK.

There are three types of API on bosonnlp.com

Start with "c_" here: Common single ones, accept multiple texts, but those texts are not related.

Start with "m_" here: Multiple ones, like cluster API, it's meaningless to cluster single text.

Start with "s_" here: Single ones, that limited to one text a time.


check http://docs.bosonnlp.com for API details.
